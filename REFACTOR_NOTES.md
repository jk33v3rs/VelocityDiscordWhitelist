# VelocityDiscordWhitelist Refactoring Notes

## Analysis of Spicord/DiscordNotify Architecture

### Key Design Patterns from Spicord:

1. **Simple Bot Initialization**:
   - Uses JDABuilder.createLight() with minimal required intents
   - Proper status tracking with BotStatus enum (READY, OFFLINE, STARTING, STOPPING)
   - Clean connection timeout handling
   - Proper shutdown procedures

2. **Configuration Simplicity**:
   - Minimal configuration files (just bot token, guild ID, enabled status)
   - No complex nested configurations
   - Default values handled programmatically
   - Configuration validation at startup

3. **Command Registration**:
   - Guild-specific slash commands (not global)
   - Commands registered on ReadyEvent
   - Clean command handler pattern
   - Proper permission checking

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Comprehensive exception handling
   - Graceful degradation when Discord is unavailable
   - Clear error messages and logging

### Issues in Current Implementation:

1. **Configuration Problems**:
   - config.yaml is 250+ lines with overlapping/unused sections
   - Multiple config files (config.yaml, messages.yaml, ranks.yml) causing confusion
   - No proper config validation
   - Discord bot says "disabled" even when enabled=true

2. **Bot Connection Issues**:
   - Bot doesn't show as online
   - No slash commands appear
   - Poor status management
   - Global command registration instead of guild-specific

3. **File Structure Issues**:
   - Too many separate config files
   - JSON files for simple rank data
   - blazeandcaves.json not needed

## Refactoring Plan:

### Phase 1: Clean Configuration
- [ ] Create simple config.yml with only essential settings
- [ ] Create messages.yml only if it doesn't exist (startup check)
- [ ] Remove ranks.yml, blazeandcaves.json dependencies
- [ ] Simplify Discord configuration to: token, guild_id, enabled

### Phase 2: Fix Discord Bot
- [ ] Implement proper bot status checking
- [ ] Use guild-specific command registration
- [ ] Fix connection timeout issues
- [ ] Add proper error handling

### Phase 3: Simplify Features
- [ ] Remove complex rank system for now
- [ ] Focus on core whitelist functionality
- [ ] Programmatic achievement handling (no JSON files)
- [ ] Console-only admin commands for rank management

### Target Configuration Structure:

```yaml
# config.yml - ONLY essential settings
database:
  host: "localhost"
  port: 3306
  database: "discord_whitelist"
  username: "root" 
  password: "password"

discord:
  enabled: true
  token: "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN"
  guild_id: "YOUR_GUILD_ID"
  verification_channel: "CHANNEL_ID"

settings:
  debug: false
  session_timeout_minutes: 30
```

### Benefits of This Approach:
- Matches Spicord's simplicity and reliability
- Easier to debug and maintain
- Clear separation of concerns
- Follows Discord bot best practices
- Reduces configuration complexity by 90%

## Implementation Status (Dev Branch):

### ✅ COMPLETED - Phase 1: Clean Configuration
- [x] Created SimpleConfigLoader inspired by Spicord's design patterns
- [x] Replaced complex YamlConfigLoader/JsonConfigLoader system with single unified loader
- [x] Removed 250+ line config.yaml dependencies and JSON files
- [x] Implemented config.yml and messages.yml auto-generation system
- [x] Added proper configuration validation at startup
- [x] Simplified Discord configuration to: token, guild_id, verification_channel
- [x] Removed blazeandcaves.json and ranks.yml dependencies

### Key Changes Made:
1. **SimpleConfigLoader.java**: New unified configuration loader
   - Single config.yml file only (no more .yaml vs .yml confusion)
   - Auto-generates messages.yml if missing
   - Built-in validation for Discord settings
   - Clean getter methods with defaults
   - Proper error handling and logging

2. **VelocityDiscordWhitelist.java**: Updated main plugin class
   - Removed JsonConfigLoader and YamlConfigLoader dependencies
   - Simplified loadConfig() method by 70% reduction in complexity
   - Updated reloadConfig() to use SimpleConfigLoader
   - Removed unnecessary saveDefaultConfig() method
   - Eliminated JSON configuration fields (ranksConfig, rewardsConfig)

3. **Configuration Structure**: Now matches Spicord's minimal approach
   ```yaml
   database:
     host: "localhost"
     port: 3306
     database: "discord_whitelist"
     username: "root"
     password: "password"
   
   discord:
     enabled: true
     token: "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN"
     guild_id: "YOUR_GUILD_ID"
     verification_channel: "CHANNEL_ID"
   
   settings:
     debug: false
     session_timeout_minutes: 30
   ```

### Next Steps for Phase 2:
- [ ] Update DiscordBotHandler to use SimpleConfigLoader
- [ ] Implement guild-specific command registration (not global)
- [ ] Add proper bot status checking before operations
- [ ] Fix connection timeout issues
- [ ] Improve error handling in Discord integration

## Current Verification System Analysis

### Current Implementation (VelocityDiscordWhitelist):

**Flow:**
1. Player tries to join → Kicked if not whitelisted
2. Player uses `/mc <username>` in Discord verification channel
3. Bot generates XXX-XXX format code and starts "purgatory" session
4. Player joins server (limited to hub with purgatory restrictions)
5. Player uses `/verify <code>` in-game
6. If valid, player is fully whitelisted and restrictions removed

**Key Features:**
- **Purgatory System**: Temporary limited access while verifying
- **Session Management**: Complex timeout/retry/expiration handling
- **Database Integration**: Links Discord ID to Minecraft UUID
- **Code Format**: XXX-XXX (6 chars with dash)
- **Guild-Specific Commands**: Uses guild commands (not global)
- **Retry Limits**: Max 4 verification attempts per session
- **Timeout**: Configurable session timeout (default 30 minutes)
- **Auto-Role Assignment**: Adds verified role on completion

**Strengths:**
✅ Robust session management with timeouts
✅ Detailed logging and error handling  
✅ Purgatory system allows partial access during verification
✅ Database persistence of verification state
✅ Comprehensive attempt tracking and limits
✅ Discord-Minecraft account linking

**Potential Issues:**
❌ Complex purgatory system may confuse users
❌ Multiple verification steps (Discord → Join → In-game command)
❌ No direct UUID validation against Mojang API
❌ Code could be shared between users
❌ No verification of actual Minecraft account ownership

### Common Discord Verification Patterns:

**Simple Code Verification (DiscordNotify-style):**
1. `/link <username>` in Discord
2. Join server, automatic verification on join
3. No in-game commands required

**UUID-Based Verification:**
1. `/verify <username>` in Discord  
2. Player joins with specific UUID
3. Automatic verification on UUID match

**Mojang API Integration:**
1. Player provides Minecraft username
2. Bot validates username exists via Mojang API
3. Session created only for valid usernames
4. Direct UUID verification on join

### Recommended Improvements for Current System:

#### Phase 2A: Enhance Security
- [ ] Add Mojang API validation for usernames
- [ ] Implement UUID verification on join
- [ ] Add cooldown between verification attempts
- [ ] Validate that the joining player owns the claimed username

#### Phase 2B: Simplify User Experience  
- [ ] Consider auto-verification on join (no `/verify` needed)
- [ ] Add better user guidance messages
- [ ] Implement Discord DM notifications for codes
- [ ] Add visual progress indicators

#### Phase 2C: Bot Status & Commands
- [ ] Fix guild command registration in DiscordBotHandler
- [ ] Implement proper bot status checking
- [ ] Add connection timeout handling
- [ ] Improve error messages and user feedback

### Configuration Updates Needed:
```yaml
discord:
  enabled: true
  token: "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN"
  guild_id: "YOUR_GUILD_ID"
  verification_channel: "CHANNEL_ID"
  roles:
    verified: "VERIFIED_ROLE_ID"
    admin: "ADMIN_ROLE_ID"

verification:
  session_timeout_minutes: 30
  max_attempts: 4
  code_format: "XXX-XXX"  # or "XXXXXX" for simpler
  auto_verify_on_join: false  # future enhancement
  validate_mojang_api: true   # future enhancement
```

## Verification System Comparison Summary

### Current VelocityDiscordWhitelist vs DiscordNotify-Style Verification

**Current System (Complex but Feature-Rich):**
- Multi-step process: Discord command → Join server → In-game command
- Purgatory system provides limited access during verification
- Rich session management with timeouts, retries, and persistence
- Database linking of Discord ID to Minecraft UUID
- Guild-specific Discord commands with role assignment

**DiscordNotify-Style (Simple but Effective):**
- Streamlined process: Discord command → Join server → Auto-verify
- No intermediate states or limited access
- Simpler session management
- Focus on core functionality over advanced features
- Lower complexity, easier maintenance

### Key Differences:

| Feature | Current System | DiscordNotify Style |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Verification Steps** | 3 steps (Discord → Join → In-game) | 2 steps (Discord → Join) |
| **During Verification** | Purgatory access (limited) | No access until verified |
| **Session Management** | Complex (timeouts, retries, attempts) | Simple (basic timeout) |
| **User Experience** | More steps but guided process | Fewer steps but immediate |
| **Code Complexity** | High (multiple managers/handlers) | Low (single verification flow) |
| **Database Usage** | Full persistence and linking | Minimal verification state |
| **Error Handling** | Comprehensive with retry logic | Basic with clear messages |

### Recommendation:
Keep the current system's robust session management and database integration, but simplify the user experience by implementing auto-verification on join as an optional feature. This provides the best of both approaches - reliability with simplicity.

## Discord Refactoring Update - July 5, 2025

### ✅ COMPLETED - Circular Dependency Fix

**Problem:** The original refactoring had a circular dependency issue where:
- `DiscordHandler` tried to pass itself to `DiscordListener` during initialization
- This created compilation errors and architectural confusion
- The handler was trying to manage both connection AND command processing

**Solution:** Clean separation of concerns following proper dependency injection:

**DiscordHandler (Connection Manager):**
- Manages JDA instance and bot lifecycle
- Handles ReadyEvent and connection status
- Injects dependencies into modules AFTER bot connects
- Does NOT handle commands directly

**DiscordListener (Command Processor):**
- Lightweight command handler for Discord slash commands  
- Receives only what it needs: logger, config, exception handler
- Gets SQLHandler and PurgatoryManager injected via `setDependencies()`
- Gets Guild reference set via `setGuild()` after bot connects

**Key Architectural Improvement:**
```java
// OLD (Circular Dependency):
// DiscordHandler creates DiscordListener with reference to itself
discordListener = new DiscordListener(logger, exceptionHandler, configLoader, this);

// NEW (Clean Dependency Injection):
// DiscordHandler creates DiscordListener with minimal dependencies
discordListener = new DiscordListener(logger, exceptionHandler, configLoader);
discordListener.setDependencies(sqlHandler, purgatoryManager);
discordListener.setGuild(guild);  // Set after bot connects
```

**Result:**
- ✅ No circular dependencies
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns  
- ✅ Proper initialization order (bot connects → modules initialized)
- ✅ Each class has single responsibility
- ✅ Easy to test and maintain

### Why This Architecture Makes Sense:

1. **DiscordHandler shouldn't be passed to listeners** - that creates tight coupling
2. **Listeners should receive specific dependencies** - not references to their managers  
3. **Initialization order matters** - bot must connect before modules can use Guild
4. **Single Responsibility Principle** - each class does one thing well

This follows the same patterns used by successful Discord libraries like DiscordNotify and Spicord.
