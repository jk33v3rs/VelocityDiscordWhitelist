- **Service Locator Pattern**: Some static utility classes could benefit from dependency injection
- **Testing Infrastructure**: No visible unit tests or integration tests

## Security Analysis

### Current Security Measures
1. **SQL Injection Prevention**: Consistent use of PreparedStatements
2. **Input Validation**: Username format validation in Discord commands
3. **Session Management**: Time-limited verification codes with attempt limits
4. **Connection Security**: HikariCP connection pooling with proper resource management

### Security Vulnerabilities and Recommendations

#### HIGH PRIORITY
1. **Database Credentials**: Consider using environment variables or encrypted configuration
2. **Discord Token Security**: Ensure token is not logged or exposed in error messages
3. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting for Discord commands to prevent abuse
4. **Input Sanitization**: Enhanced validation for all user inputs, especially Discord usernames

#### MEDIUM PRIORITY
1. **Logging Security**: Sanitize sensitive data in debug logs
2. **Error Messages**: Avoid exposing internal system details in user-facing errors
3. **Command Injection**: Validate console commands before execution in RewardsHandler

## Code Quality Assessment

### Positive Aspects
1. **Documentation**: Excellent method-level documentation with detailed JavaDoc headers
2. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks with proper logging
3. **Code Style**: Consistent camelCase naming and proper indentation
4. **Constants**: Good use of constants for configuration values

### Areas Needing Improvement

#### Code Duplication
- **Database Connection Patterns**: Repetitive try-with-resources patterns could be abstracted
- **Error Handling**: Similar exception handling patterns across multiple classes
- **Validation Logic**: Username validation duplicated in multiple locations

#### Method Complexity
Several methods exceed recommended complexity thresholds:
- `SQLHandler.checkBedrockWhitelist()` - 45+ lines with complex branching
- `DiscordBotHandler.initialize()` - Complex initialization with nested callbacks
- `VelocityDiscordWhitelist.onProxyInitialization()` - Long method with multiple responsibilities

#### Resource Management
- Some ResultSet operations in `SQLHandler.listWhitelisted()` may not properly close resources
- Connection handling in async operations needs review

## Performance Analysis

### Optimizations Implemented
1. **Database Indexing**: Proper indexes on frequently queried columns
2. **Connection Pooling**: HikariCP with appropriate pool sizing
3. **Async Operations**: Non-blocking operations for database and Discord interactions
4. **Caching**: Session caching in EnhancedPurgatoryManager

### Performance Concerns
1. **Database Queries**: Some queries could benefit from optimization:
   - Daily XP breakdown queries may be expensive for large datasets
   - Bedrock player checks involve multiple sequential queries
2. **Memory Usage**: Large result sets in XP event queries should implement pagination
3. **Thread Pool Management**: No visible thread pool configuration for async operations

## Database Design Review

### Schema Strengths
- **Proper Foreign Keys**: Referential integrity maintained
- **Indexing Strategy**: Good coverage of frequently queried columns
- **Data Types**: Appropriate data types for different field purposes
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging tables for XP events and rank changes

### Schema Improvements Needed
1. **Data Validation**: Add database-level constraints for data integrity
2. **Partitioning**: Large tables (xp_events) may benefit from partitioning
3. **Backup Strategy**: Implement automated backup procedures
4. **Migration Scripts**: Version-controlled database migrations

## Integration Analysis

### Discord Integration
**Strengths:**
- Robust connection handling with retry logic
- Proper event handling for slash commands
