# VelocityDiscordWhitelist TODO List

- Add detailed function headers (purpose, params, return) to all methods, per your coding standards.
- Ensure all error handling uses the ExceptionHandler and logs sufficient detail.
- Use camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for classes, UPPER_CASE for constants.
- Avoid exposing sensitive info in logs or error messages.
- Add more granular startup status reporting (e.g., which subsystem failed, not just "plugin failed").
- Ensure all async operations (especially Discord and SQL) have timeouts and surface failures in the status report.
- Add runtime diagnostics (e.g., `/discordstatus` command) for admins to check bot health.
- Ensure all Discord event listeners are registered/unregistered cleanly on plugin enable/disable.
- Document all Discord command flows and error cases in the code and in project docs.
- Refactor repeated query logic into reusable private methods.
- Add more detailed SQL error logging (e.g., include query and parameters, but redact sensitive info).
- Add connection health checks and auto-reconnect logic.
- Add more detailed logging for purgatory state transitions (entry, exit, timeout, blacklist).
- Expose purgatory state to admins via a command or status page.
- Ensure all edge cases (e.g., server restart during purgatory) are handled gracefully. For example, in the case of a server crash, check to see if there are any out-of-time purgatory sessions and clean them up on startup so that players can simply restart their timed purgatory session by going back to discord and sending /mc <playername> in the relevant channel(s) again.
- Document the full rank progression system in project docs for maintainability.
- `/reload` command in `BrigadierCommandHandler` is a placeholderâ€”needs real config reload logic.
- Implement async config reload for `/reload`, with proper locking and error feedback.
- Add usage examples and error case documentation for all commands.
- Add permission checks and rate limiting for admin commands.
- Document integration requirements and setup in project docs.
- Ensure all exceptions are routed through the ExceptionHandler for consistency.
- Add log levels (INFO, WARN, ERROR) and make them configurable in config.yaml.
- Document logging and error handling strategy in project docs.
- Add Javadoc headers to all model classes and fields for clarity.
- Make models immutable where possible for thread safety.
- Document model relationships and usage in project docs.
- Document all config options and defaults in project docs.
- Keep all documentation in sync with code changes, especially for new features or refactors.
- Add a "troubleshooting" section to the README for common issues.
- Generate a Javadoc or similar API docs for public classes/methods.
